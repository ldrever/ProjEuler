	 * How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century?
	 * 
	 * First, worth nothing that the 100 and 400 year rules cancel out, we we can
	 * just use naive 4-year based leap year calculations.
	 * 
	 * There will be 25 4-year blocks to consider... each of these will start on a
	 * different day though, perhaps...
	 * 
	 * How about we start by considering all hundred Januaries... 1/1/1900 being Monday
	 * means that 1/1/1901 was a Tuesday - as 1900 itself is NOT leap.
	 * 
	 * How about we start to classify as follows
	 * 
	 * Let's temporarily ignore January and February, and observe that the first of
	 * any given month has the following behaviour:
	 * 
	 * 1. it increases by 1 (mod 7) per year
	 * 2. it increases by 1 more (mod 7) per multiple of 4 years

		 * Well we can see from the block that the final December begins on a 6. So a second block would

		 * instead of 4.
		 * 
		 * Well look at it this way. If we say that the EXACT same grid repeated in the next 4-year block
		 * ... that could only be true if the number-meanings were changed, such that 4 DOESN'T mean thursday
		 * but now means Tuesday... or that Tuesday USED to mean 2 and now means 4... equivalently Sunday USED
		 * to mean 0 and now means 2... 
		 * 
		 * So: the Sunday-count across 4 adjacent blocks is... if we use the block below for 1901-4, meaning 
		 * 2 is Sunday here... well then we want to count 2s + 4s + 6s + 1s.
		 * 
		 * Ah no wait - that goes wrong because the leap needs to be LAST...
